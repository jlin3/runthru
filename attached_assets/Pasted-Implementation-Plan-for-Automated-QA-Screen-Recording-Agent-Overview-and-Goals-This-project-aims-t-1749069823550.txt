Implementation Plan for Automated QA Screen Recording Agent

Overview and Goals

This project aims to build an AI-powered agent that can automatically execute a web user flow, record the screen during the interaction, narrate the actions with a synthetic voiceover, and deliver the resulting video to stakeholders (similar to a Loom recording). The goal is to streamline QA and demo workflows – given a set of testing criteria (or even code changes), the agent will produce a narrated screencast of the feature being tested. Key considerations include integration with OpenAI’s latest agent tools, automated browser control, text-to-speech voice generation, video compositing (with a talking avatar bubble), and automated delivery (via email or Loom-style share link). The solution should be achievable within a hackathon timeframe (~5 hours) by leveraging existing SDKs and APIs.

System Architecture Overview

The system is composed of several modular components that work in sequence to produce the final video:
	•	1. Input Processing & Test Flow Definition – Accepts testing instructions or extracts steps from code diffs, producing a structured list of actions to perform.
	•	2. Browser Automation & Screen Recording – Launches a browser to execute the steps (either via hard-coded script or AI agent control) and captures a video of the interaction.
	•	3. Narration Generation (Voiceover) – Creates a natural-language narration for the steps and synthesizes it to audio using an AI voice.
	•	4. Video Composition (Loom-style) – Combines the screen recording with the voiceover audio, and overlays a presenter avatar (bubble in corner) to mimic a Loom video.
	•	5. Delivery Mechanism – Shares the video by either uploading to a platform or sending via email to stakeholders, potentially with an inline player or link.

Each of these components can be implemented with available tools/SDKs, and orchestrated using OpenAI’s agentic capabilities for a high degree of automation and intelligence.

1. Interpreting Test Criteria and Defining Steps

Parsing Instructions: The agent will first translate the testing criteria or code changes into concrete step-by-step actions. Initially, this can be hard-coded for a known flow (e.g. “Go to bookvid.com > open marketplace > scroll and select a profile > click ‘Personalized Video Request’ > proceed through payment”). For a more dynamic solution, we leverage GPT-4 to interpret instructions or even analyze GitHub diffs:
	•	Natural Language Input: If given an English description of a test scenario, a GPT-4 model (via the OpenAI Responses API) can break it into structured steps (possibly by calling a function or just via prompt). The agent might output JSON like [{action: "goto", url: "https://bookvid.com"}, {action: "click", selector: "..."}, ...]. We can fine-tune prompts so the model reliably identifies URLs, selectors or text to click.
	•	Code Diff Input: If provided with a GitHub diff or PR description, use GPT-4 (or Codex) to infer what user-facing changes were made. The model could be asked: “Analyze these code changes and suggest how to test the updated functionality.” For example, if a new payment flow was added, GPT might suggest steps to navigate to that flow and execute it. This is an aspirational feature – in the hackathon timeframe, one might handle a simple scenario (like parse commit messages or comments for hints), but it’s a powerful extension for the future.

OpenAI Agent Integration: Here we can utilize the OpenAI Agents SDK. The new Responses API supports function calling and tool use, meaning we could give the agent a custom function like define_test_steps(diff). Internally, this function could call GPT-4 to interpret diffs or requirements. We also have the option to use ChatGPT Code capabilities (formerly Codex) to generate automation code from the steps. For example, the agent could be prompted to output a Playwright script given a description of the flow. Using GPT to assist with coding can drastically speed up writing boilerplate for new flows.

2. Browser Automation & Screen Recording

Once the steps are determined, the agent must perform them in a browser while recording the screen. There are two approaches here:
	•	(A) Scripted Automation with Playwright/Selenium: For reliability under time constraints, we can directly use a browser automation library (e.g. Playwright or Puppeteer in Node, or Selenium/Playwright in Python). Playwright is a strong choice because it can programmatically control Chromium/Firefox/WebKit and also record videos of the session out-of-the-box* ￼ ￼. We would write a script to:
	1.	Launch the browser (headless or headed).
	2.	Start recording (e.g. in Playwright, create a context with recordVideo set to a directory ￼).
	3.	Execute each action: navigate to URLs, click elements (by selector or text), type into fields, scroll, etc. Add waits where needed (for page loads or for narration pacing).
	4.	Close the browser, which finalizes the video file on disk (Playwright saves the video when the context is closed ￼ ￼). We then have, say, flow_demo.webm or .mp4 recorded.
	•	(B) AI Agent-Controlled Browser (OpenAI CUA): For a more advanced solution, leverage OpenAI’s Computer Use tool (CUA) in the Responses API. This allows the GPT-4 model to directly control a browser by “seeing” the UI and issuing mouse/keyboard commands. In practice, we set up a local Playwright browser environment and let the agent drive it. The agent will output actions like click(x, y) or type("text") which our environment executes, and then we return a screenshot for the next model prompt ￼. This creates a feedback loop where the agent observes the interface and completes multi-step tasks autonomously. OpenAI specifically notes that “developers can use the computer use tool to automate browser-based workflows like performing quality assurance on web apps” ￼, which aligns perfectly with our use case. In a hackathon, one could use OpenAI’s sample CUA app (which uses Playwright under the hood for a local browser ￼) to get started quickly.
Trade-offs: The agent-driven approach is cutting-edge and demonstrates integration of OpenAI’s newest capabilities, but it may be slower or occasionally error-prone (since the model might misclick or need to be constrained by good prompts). A pragmatic approach is to use approach (A) for the demo (for guaranteed results), while highlighting that approach (B) is a forward-looking enhancement for dynamic flows. Both approaches ultimately yield a screen recording of the flow.

Screen Recording Considerations: If using Playwright, we simply rely on its recorded video file. If using the CUA agent, we need to record the session ourselves (perhaps by also running a parallel screen capture). Options include:
	•	Using Playwright’s recordVideo even with the agent (since the agent’s actions are executed via Playwright, we could still enable video capture on the browser context).
	•	Alternatively, capturing the screen or browser window output (e.g. using FFmpeg with Xvfb on a headless Linux, or a tool like OBS in a more manual setup). For simplicity, enabling Playwright’s video recording is easiest.

By the end of this step, we have a raw screen recording video of the test flow, typically a few seconds to a minute long, ready for narration overlay.

3. Voiceover Generation with Synthetic Voice

With the test steps executed, the next component is creating a voiceover narration that will be overlaid on the video. The process is:
	•	Narration Script Creation: We want the voiceover to clearly explain each step and its purpose, as if a person is walking the viewer through the demo. We can automate this using GPT-4: prompt the model with the list of actions (and perhaps some context like the feature or test goal) and ask it to generate a friendly descriptive commentary. For example, given a step “Click the ‘Personalized Video Request’ button,” GPT-4 might produce a line like “Now I click on the ‘Personalized Video Request’ to start requesting a custom video…”. This adds a human-like touch. If needed, we can include dynamic details (like reading out a price or confirming a successful payment) by having the automation script capture those details and feeding them into the prompt for narration text.
	•	Text-to-Speech Synthesis: Once we have the narration text (either as one continuous script or broken into segments per step), we convert it to speech audio. We have two primary options:
	•	OpenAI’s Voice Models: OpenAI has introduced voice capabilities (e.g., as seen in ChatGPT’s mobile app). If accessible via API, we could use an OpenAI voice agent to generate natural speech. This might involve a call to a voice synthesis endpoint with the script text (if available in the new API stack).
	•	ElevenLabs API: For high-quality voice and expressive narration, ElevenLabs is a great choice. The ElevenLabs TTS API can produce “lifelike speech” from text with minimal effort ￼. In the hack, we can call their API (using an SDK or HTTP requests) to generate an audio file (e.g. MP3 or WAV) for the narration. This only requires an API key and a simple POST request with the text and chosen voice. The response will be the spoken audio. We could use a default narrator voice or even clone a voice if desired, but default voices should suffice for a demo.
	•	Segmented vs. Single Audio: We need to decide if the narration will be one continuous track or multiple clips aligned to steps:
	•	A continuous single audio track is simpler to handle when merging with video (just one file). To do this, the narration text would be one script covering the whole flow. We must ensure the spoken audio length roughly matches the video length. This can be achieved by tweaking the script (adding pauses or filler if the video is long, or instructing the automation to pause at certain points to let the narration catch up). We might generate this single audio file and later adjust timing by either pausing the video or adding silence.
	•	Step-wise audio clips: Alternatively, generate separate audio clips for each step. This way, we can precisely overlay each clip at the correct timestamp in the video (e.g., the audio for “Click X button” starts right when that action happens on screen). This yields tighter synchronization but requires a bit more video editing work (we’d have to merge multiple audio segments onto the timeline). Given the time constraint, an easier method is to generate a single audio and ensure our automated script’s pacing matches it (perhaps by pre-estimating speech duration of each segment and inserting await page.waitForTimeout(x) delays accordingly).

In summary, this step produces a narration audio file (or files) using AI voice synthesis. We have leveraged GPT-4 for content creation of the narration and ElevenLabs (or OpenAI’s voice) for audio rendering.

4. Video Composition and Loom-Style Avatar Overlay

Now we have two main pieces of content: the screen recording video and the narration audio. The next step is to combine them and add the “Loom-style” presenter bubble overlay:
	•	Audio-Video Merging: Using a video processing tool (such as FFmpeg or a high-level library), we overlay the narration audio onto the screen recording video. If we generated one continuous audio track, this is straightforward: we can use ffmpeg to merge audio and video (e.g., ffmpeg -i screen.mp4 -i narration.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac output.mp4). If the audio is shorter than the video, we may need to loop the last frame or add silence; if longer, we may extend the video duration by freezing the last frame. Ideally, we aimed to match lengths in the prior step. Many hacking demos have used FFmpeg because of its flexibility and speed – for instance, to combine an image and audio into a video, one could use a command like ffmpeg -loop 1 -i image.png -i audio.wav -shortest out.mp4 (looping the image until audio ends) ￼. In our case, we have a full motion video instead of a static image.
	•	Adding the Avatar Bubble: A key aspect of Loom recordings is the circular picture-in-picture of the presenter speaking. We can simulate this by overlaying an avatar image or video in a corner of the screen recording:
	•	For a static solution, choose an image to represent the “AI agent” (could be a profile photo or a cartoon avatar). We ensure it’s a circle (by using a transparent PNG or masking it in a video editor). Using FFmpeg’s overlay filter, we can place this image on top of the video at the desired position (bottom-right, for example). FFmpeg supports overlay with coordinates; e.g., overlay=25:25 would put an image at (25px,25px) from top-left ￼. We will adjust coordinates to bottom-right and perhaps a smaller size. We can also set it to display throughout the video (using FFmpeg’s enable='between(t,0,VIDEO_DURATION)' to show it for the entire clip). This can be done in one command along with audio merging via a complex filter graph.
	•	For a more dynamic avatar, one could generate a talking head video (using a service like D-ID or Synthesia) where an animated character speaks our narration. However, generating that in real-time might be out of scope for 5 hours. Instead, a clever trick could be to use the OpenAI’s image generation or avatar generation to get a neutral face, and just animate a simple pulsing border or audio waveform around the static image to indicate talking. Given time constraints, a static image is acceptable for the demo.
	•	Another creative approach: use the webcam to record the actual hacker (if human involvement is allowed) speaking the script, and overlay that video. But since we want an automated agent, we assume no live person – the synthesized voice is our “presenter.”
	•	Tooling: FFmpeg CLI is a reliable choice and can be invoked easily from Node or Python. There are libraries like MoviePy (Python) or FFmpeg.js / fluent-ffmpeg (Node) that provide programmatic access. For speed, directly calling ffmpeg with a constructed command might be easiest. We will have to ensure FFmpeg is installed in the environment or use a Docker container that has it.
	•	Example FFmpeg command to overlay an image onto a video (from a StackExchange solution):

ffmpeg -i screen.mp4 -i avatar.png -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v] overlay=W-w-10:H-h-10:enable='between(t,0,300)'" -c:a copy output.mp4

This would place avatar.png at 10px from bottom-right of the video (using W and H for output width/height and w,h for overlay dimensions), and keep it there for 300 seconds (or the entire video if shorter) ￼. We copy the audio (-c:a copy) from the input which already has narration, or if narration isn’t in screen.mp4 yet, we’d include the audio merge in filter_complex as well.

After this step, we have a polished MP4 video that resembles a Loom recording: it shows the product flow on screen, with a voiceover explaining it, and an avatar bubble of the “agent” in the corner speaking.

5. Delivery to Stakeholders

The final component is delivering the video to the relevant people (product managers, QA team, etc.), ideally as seamlessly as Loom would.
	•	Via Email: The simplest approach is to send the video file or a link via email. We can automate this using an email API or SMTP:
	•	Use Node.js Nodemailer or a Python equivalent to send an email with the MP4 as an attachment. This requires an SMTP server or service (for a hack, one might use a Gmail SMTP or a service like SendGrid). Nodemailer supports attachments easily ￼. In code, we’d specify attachments: [{ filename: "demo.mp4", path: "./output/demo.mp4" }] in the mail options.
	•	Alternatively, upload the video to cloud storage (like an AWS S3 bucket or Google Drive) and email a share link. This avoids large attachments and is more akin to Loom (which sends a link). An advantage is that the email can include an embedded thumbnail or even HTML preview.
	•	Via Loom or Similar: The prompt mentions possibly delivering via Loom’s platform. Loom doesn’t currently offer a public REST API to upload arbitrary videos ￼. They do have a developer SDK, but it’s for embedding the Loom recorder in apps, not for uploading existing files. Given this, a workaround for a Loom-style share could be:
	•	Use the Loom SDK to programmatically record the video through their interface (not ideal since we already have a recording).
	•	Simply mimic Loom by hosting the video on a simple webpage that auto-plays it with an interface. For hack demo purposes, we might skip actual Loom integration and focus on email or a custom share link.
	•	Mention: If the target was enterprise internal use, an alternative is integrating with a communications platform – for example, post the video link to a Slack channel via Slack API, or use Twilio to SMS a link. Notably, OpenAI’s Responses API now easily connects to external services like Twilio with minimal code ￼, so the agent itself could send notifications: e.g., using a function call tool to trigger an email or Slack webhook. This highlights real-world integration where the AI not only produces content but also disseminates it automatically.

Security & Access: If the test flow required login or sensitive data, ensure the automation uses test accounts or runs in a safe environment. The agent should not expose secrets in the video. In a CI/CD context, this agent could run on each deployment and email a summary video of key user journeys to the team – a very compelling use-case for QA.

OpenAI Integration & Orchestration

Throughout the design, we leverage OpenAI’s ecosystem to maximize automation:
	•	Responses API & Agents SDK: We use the Responses API’s built-in tools (like web_search, file_search, and especially computer_use) to give our agent real-world capabilities ￼ ￼. The computer_use tool is central for automating the browser – essentially letting GPT-4 act as a pseudo user clicking and typing in the UI, which we execute via a Playwright environment ￼. This significantly reduces custom scripting for each new flow; the agent can generalize instructions. We wrap the agent in the Agents SDK structure for easier orchestration of the multi-step workflow (the SDK can manage the loop of the agent observing and acting until the task is done ￼). Observability tools from the SDK can help debug or trace the steps if something goes wrong.
	•	GPT-4 (ChatGPT) for Reasoning & Code: The LLM is used not only for controlling UI, but also for reasoning about what steps to do (especially from high-level descriptions). We effectively get an “AI QA engineer” that can be told “Test the payment flow” and it figures out how to do so. Additionally, GPT-4 (with code capabilities) helps generate any boilerplate code needed (for instance, writing the Playwright script, or writing the FFmpeg command through the Code Interpreter tool). The new Responses API even integrates the Code Interpreter, allowing the agent to handle data or file manipulation tasks in-session ￼. That means the agent could, for example, call a code tool to programmatically merge the audio and video – offloading the need for us to manually script FFmpeg. This is a huge time-saver and fits the hackathon “use OpenAI for as much as possible” ethos.
	•	Voice Synthesis: If using OpenAI’s voice (if available), that keeps everything in one ecosystem. Otherwise, using ElevenLabs is straightforward and well-documented – an acceptable external dependency in a hack. The voice adds a “wow factor” to the demo, making it feel like a real person narrated the video.

Tools, SDKs, and Resources to Bootstrap Development

To execute this in under 5 hours, we rely on high-level libraries and existing examples:
	•	OpenAI Agents SDK & Examples: Use OpenAI’s openai-cua-sample-app on GitHub as a starting point for the agent that performs computer actions via Playwright ￼. This provides a ready-made loop and examples (like how to set up the environment, provide initial instructions, etc.), saving time on integration.
	•	Playwright or Puppeteer: For direct control of the browser and video recording. Playwright is preferred for its ease of video capture and multi-browser support. The Playwright docs show simple config to enable recording ￼. If not already installed, it can be added via npm or pip and requires a quick playwright install for browser binaries.
	•	ElevenLabs (or TTS API): Use the ElevenLabs Python SDK (pip install elevenlabs) or Node fetch calls to their REST API. The developer quickstart guide demonstrates how to create an API key and make the first request to generate speech ￼ – this can be implemented in a few lines of code. We should prepare the narration text and call their API to get an audio file (which comes back as binary data or a URL to download).
	•	FFmpeg: Ensure FFmpeg is available for video processing. If using a Python environment, MoviePy can be installed to merge audio and video in a Pythonic way (MoviePy will use ffmpeg under the hood). In Node, fluent-ffmpeg allows building commands in JS. But given time, writing an ffmpeg command directly might be quickest (there are many online examples for merging audio/video and overlays, as cited above).
	•	Email/Notification APIs: For emailing, Nodemailer (Node) or an email service SDK (like SendGrid’s Node/Python SDK) can send messages with minimal setup. Just need SMTP credentials or an API key. Optionally, prepare a nicely formatted email with the video link or attachment. If going the Slack route, use Slack webhook URL and an HTTP POST (trivial to do).
	•	Testing & Iteration: Run the agent on a sample flow (like the Bookvid example) and verify the video output. If something fails (e.g., an element not found), adjust the step instructions or provide the agent with more explicit guidance (like CSS selectors or using the tool’s ability to search text on screen).
	•	Safety & Permissions: If the site is live and the flow involves transactions, use a test environment or sandbox (to avoid actual charges). In a hack demo, it’s fine to use a staging site or dummy actions.

By leveraging these tools, the implementation becomes mostly about gluing components rather than writing low-level code from scratch. The OpenAI agent can handle logic and orchestration, while Playwright handles browser internals, ElevenLabs handles voice synthesis, and FFmpeg handles video editing – each excelling at its task.

Conclusion and Demo Potential

In summary, the plan is to assemble an AI agent that takes a description of a user flow and produces a narrated screen-recording video with minimal human intervention. The architecture uses OpenAI’s latest SDKs to interpret instructions and drive a browser (even performing QA tasks autonomously ￼), and integrates with best-in-class tools for voice (to speak the actions in a human-like manner ￼) and video editing. The final delivery via email or link ensures the result is immediately useful to stakeholders.

This implementation is feasible to build in under 5 hours by reusing available components and examples. It showcases a compelling real-world use case: automated product walkthroughs and QA demos, which can save teams time and ensure everyone is aligned on the current behavior of the application. The demo video produced by this agent – complete with voiceover and avatar – will be highly engaging, essentially an AI QA engineer giving a tour of the feature. This creativity, combined with solid OpenAI integration and technical execution, should meet the judging criteria and result in a impressive hackathon project.
